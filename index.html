        <h2>Petition / Cause</h2>
        <p>Support our cause by signing and spreading the word that MaximilianMus was FALSELY and BASELESSLY accused of serious wrongdoing. Many of the ALLEGATIONS were either ENTIRELY UNTRUE or DRASTICALLY EXAGGERATED.

  <h2>Proof For Max's Innocence</h2>
  <p>
    To understand how MaximilianMus is innocent please watch this video by @bubu64 : https://youtu.be/2VR4VB05w_o?si=TFClrM1mtKhtFqz6 | Morever, this video by bubu64 was made before the YouTuber 'SomeOrdinaryGamer' was exposed as a FRAUD, which is why bubu64 wasn't reluctant to back the authenticity of SomeOrdinaryGamer's testimony; However, with new evidence exposing SomeOrdinaryGamer as a liar this highlights a weaknress in his chracter amd testimony.| Also, a commonly noted event is Max 'manipulating' someone who is 'mentally-ill' into eating their own fecal matter. What is often neglected from this narrative is that this man in question was a 30+ year old neo-Nazi (according to Max and eye-witnesses of the event). Furthermore, the meaning of manipulation seems to be distorted in these narratives, as here it's portrayed as this unstoppable force that prevents anyone acting against the will of MaximilianMus... Was this magic? Force? Telekinesis? The world wonders! Also, the hyper-victimization of the neurodivergent individual is played out to seem that they weren't capable of preventing this event from happening, and that they were helpless... This in-it-of-itself is fairly derogatory, as it is known that there neurodivergence varies far and wide! Don't believe this very basic fact? Does the name Elon Musk ring a bell? Hmm, typical.  </p>
